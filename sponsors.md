# Call for Sponsors

We are seeking the sponsorship of companies for the [34rd International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management (SSDBM 2022)](http://ssdbm2022.github.io/) to be held at the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.
<!--
The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 34rd SSDBM will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation, and, for the first time, reproducibility studies of previous publications. The program of the research track will be supplemented with invited talks and demonstrations. SSDBM 2022 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management.

In order to keep registration fees low and attract especially students and young researchers, we would appreciate the financial support of companies and foundations. Sponsors for recent SSDBM conferences include Teradata, SDSC, NSF, Ericsson, and Rasdaman.
