# Welcome to SSDBM 2022
<!--
The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 34rd SSDBM will continue to be a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and evaluation. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2022 will be hosted by the University of Copenhagen at Copenhagen, Denmark, and will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship, and exchange of ideas. SSDBM 2022 aims at soliciting original ideas on Database Systems Support of statistical and scientific applications including challenges and opportunities, concepts and applications, and future trends. This year, the focus is on Database System Support of AI/Machine Learning/Data Mining. Topics from other areas of data management, databases, and information systems are welcome, as long as the submitted work is original, unpublished, and not being considered for publication anywhere else.

The Proceedings of SSDBM 2022 will be published by ACM – International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS) and will be available in the ACM Digital Library. The best papers will be considered for publication in the Distributed and Parallel Databases (DAPD) – An International Journal of Data Science, Engineering, and Management, Springer, ISSN: 0926-8782 (pending). We solicit research papers, long (12 pages) and short (4 pages), and demo papers (4 pages).
