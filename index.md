# Welcome to SSDBM 2022
The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 34th SSDBM will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and evaluation. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2022 will be hosted by the University of Copenhagen and will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship, and exchange of ideas.

**This year the focus is on climate changes and sustainability, with a special emphasis on technologies and systems to provide an efficient use of infrastructures, resources, and services in order to guarantee sustainable and inclusive growth, sustainable urban–rural transformation through decarbonization, confront climate risks, etc.**

The best papers will be considered for publication in the Distributed and Parallel Databases (DAPD) – An International Journal of Data Science, Engineering, and Management, Springer, ISSN: 0926-8782.
