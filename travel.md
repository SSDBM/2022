## Transportation from/to Vienna International Airport

[City Airport Train (CAT)](https://www.cityairporttrain.com/en/home): The CAT offers a direct connection to the City Air Terminal (Wien-Mitte/Landstrasse, underground lines U3 and U4) in only 16 minutes. Leaving the airport, the CAT departs every half our between 06:05 and 23:35, and going to the airport between 05:38 and 23:08. Tickets are available at one of several terminals (single ticket 12 euros / return ticket 19 euros), online (single ticket 11 euros / return ticket 17 euros), or even on board (single ticket 14 euros).

Train: The train station for the "S-Bahn" is located right next to the train station of the CAT. The ride to the city center takes longer than on the CAT as it stops at several stations. However, tickets for the S-Bahn are cheaper. You can buy a ticket (valid in two zones) at the ticket machines in the train station (4.20 euros, including public transportation in Vienna). For an overview of all stops on the way from the airport to the city center, please see the schedule.

Airport Bus Shuttle: There are regular buses running from the airport to Wien Morzinplatz/Schwedenplatz (with connection to underground lines U1 and U4) Wien Dörfelstrasse/Meidling (with connection to underground line U6) Wien Westbahnhof (with connection to underground lines U3 and U6) The bus station is located directly in front of the airport arrival hall. Buses leave every 20 to 30 minutes. It takes around 30 minutes to get to Vienna by bus. Tickets (8 euros) are available on the bus or at the self-service ticket machines. Please note that the tickets are only valid for the shuttle bus, and not for public transportation in Vienna.

Taxi: The taxi stand at the airport is located in front of the arrival hall. It takes about half an hour to get to the city centre (approx. 36 euros)

## By train

The main train station of Vienna is called Wien Hauptbahnhof (commonly abbreviated as "Wien Hbf", translating to Vienna central station). It is directly connected to the underground line U1, as well as many other bus lines. The majority of trains in Austria are operated by the [ÖBB](https://www.oebb.at/en/).


## Public transportation

Vienna has an excellent public transportation system, operated by the "Wiener Linien". You can find the route map and timetables for Wiener Linien here. The fastest way to get around in Vienna is by using the underground. The university buildings of TU Wien (in particular the building at Gusshausstraße 27-29 where the conference takes place, see below) are in short walking distance to the underground stations "Karlsplatz" and "Taubstummengasse". Wiener Linien offer 4-day travel cards for the entire public transportation network of Vienna at the reduced fare of €18.20. Tickets are available at every underground station.
