# Information for Participants

<!--
**SSDBM 2020 will be an online event.**

All talks will be delivered in the form of pre-recorded videos. The links to these videos and the slides will be made available to the participants by July 6.

There will also be an interactive aspect, where participants and authors can chat online, and hold Q&A sessions. This will be facilitated via a Slack workspace, where each conference session will have a dedicated channel.

It is recommended that participants watch the videos in advance, and pose their questions at the corresponding Slack channel during the dates of **July 7--9**.

**Note:** Only registered participants of SSDBM 2021 will receive access to the links and the Slack channel.
